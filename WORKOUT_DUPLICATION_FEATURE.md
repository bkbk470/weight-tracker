# Workout Duplication Feature

## Overview
The workout duplication feature allows users to create copies of existing workouts, which are saved as new user workouts in "My Workouts" with a "Copy of [original name]" naming convention.

## Implementation Details

### Files Modified
1. **`lib/screens/workout_detail_screen.dart`**
   - Added `_duplicateWorkout()` method to handle workout duplication from the detail view
   - Updated the "Duplicate" button to call the new method instead of showing a placeholder message

2. **`lib/screens/workout_library_screen.dart`**
   - Already had duplication functionality implemented in the `onDuplicate` callback
   - No changes needed - already working correctly

## Features

### From Workout Library Screen
- Users can duplicate workouts directly from the workout list in "My Workouts" tab
- Tap the duplicate icon on any workout card
- A new workout is created with "Copy of [workout name]"
- All exercises with their settings (sets, reps, rest times, notes) are copied
- The workout list automatically refreshes to show the new workout
- Success message confirms the creation

### From Workout Detail Screen
- Users can duplicate workouts from the detail view
- Tap the "Duplicate" button in the bottom actions
- Same duplication behavior as library screen
- After duplication, user is navigated back to the workout library
- Success message confirms the creation

## Duplication Process

1. **Fetch Original Workout**: Retrieves the complete workout data including all exercises
2. **Create New Workout**: Creates a new workout with:
   - Name: "Copy of [original name]"
   - Description: Same as original
   - Difficulty: Same as original
   - Estimated duration: Same as original
3. **Duplicate Exercises**: For each exercise in the original workout:
   - Copies exercise reference
   - Preserves order
   - Copies target sets
   - Copies target reps
   - Copies rest time
   - Copies notes (if any)
4. **Save to Database**: All data is saved to Supabase as a user workout
5. **Update UI**: Shows success message and refreshes the workout list

## Error Handling

Both implementations include proper error handling:
- Checks if workout ID exists before attempting duplication
- Catches and displays any errors during the duplication process
- Shows user-friendly error messages
- Uses mounted check to prevent memory leaks

## User Experience

- **Naming Convention**: "Copy of" prefix makes it clear which workouts are duplicates
- **Ownership**: All duplicated workouts are saved as user workouts (not templates)
- **Location**: Duplicates appear in "My Workouts" tab in the workout library
- **Editability**: Duplicated workouts can be fully edited like any other user workout
- **Feedback**: Success/error messages provide clear feedback to users

## Database Integration

The duplication feature uses the following Supabase service methods:
- `getWorkout(workoutId)`: Fetches the original workout with all exercises
- `createWorkout(...)`: Creates the new workout record
- `addExerciseToWorkout(...)`: Adds each exercise to the new workout
- All operations maintain referential integrity in the database

## Testing Recommendations

1. Test duplicating workouts with various numbers of exercises (0, 1, many)
2. Test duplicating workouts with different exercise configurations
3. Verify all exercise data is correctly copied (sets, reps, rest times, notes)
4. Test error handling with invalid workout IDs
5. Verify navigation flows from both screens
6. Confirm workout list refreshes properly after duplication
7. Test with and without authentication
8. Verify database records are created correctly

## Future Enhancements

Possible improvements for the future:
- Option to rename during duplication
- Bulk duplication of multiple workouts
- Duplicate with modifications (e.g., increase weight by X%)
- Share duplicated workouts with other users
- Duplicate to a specific category or tag
