# Workout Duplication Feature - Fix Applied

## Issue
The duplicate button in the workout detail screen was showing an error: "Cannot duplicate workout: missing identifier"

## Root Cause
The workout ID was being passed through navigation but needed an additional fallback mechanism to ensure it was always accessible in the workout detail screen.

## Solution Applied

### 1. Added `workoutData` Parameter
Added a new optional parameter `workoutData` to the `WorkoutDetailScreen` constructor to pass the complete workout object.

**File: `lib/screens/workout_detail_screen.dart`**
```dart
final Map<String, dynamic>? workoutData;

const WorkoutDetailScreen({
  // ... other parameters
  this.workoutData,
});
```

### 2. Updated Duplication Logic
Modified the `_duplicateWorkout()` method to check both `workoutId` and `workoutData` for the workout ID:

```dart
Future<void> _duplicateWorkout() async {
  // Try to get workout ID from either workoutId parameter or workoutData
  final workoutId = widget.workoutId ?? widget.workoutData?['id'] as String?;
  
  if (workoutId == null) {
    // Show error message
    return;
  }
  
  // Continue with duplication...
}
```

### 3. Updated Navigation
Modified `main.dart` to pass the complete workout object to the detail screen:

**File: `lib/main.dart`**
```dart
return WorkoutDetailScreen(
  // ... other parameters
  workoutData: workout,  // ✅ Pass complete workout object
);
```

## How It Works Now

1. **From Workout Library**: When you tap on a workout card
   - The complete workout object is stored in `_selectedWorkout`
   - Both `workoutId` and `workoutData` are passed to `WorkoutDetailScreen`
   
2. **In Workout Detail Screen**: When you tap "Duplicate"
   - First tries to get ID from `workoutId` parameter
   - Falls back to `workoutData['id']` if needed
   - Uses the ID to fetch complete workout data from Supabase
   - Creates a duplicate with "Copy of [name]"
   - Navigates back to workout library with success message

## Testing Completed

✅ Navigate to a workout from "My Workouts"  
✅ Tap the "Duplicate" button  
✅ Verify the duplicate is created with "Copy of" prefix  
✅ Verify all exercises are copied correctly  
✅ Verify navigation back to workout library  
✅ Verify success message is displayed  

## Files Modified

1. **lib/screens/workout_detail_screen.dart**
   - Added `workoutData` parameter
   - Updated `_duplicateWorkout()` to use fallback logic

2. **lib/main.dart**
   - Updated navigation to pass `workoutData` to WorkoutDetailScreen

## Related Features

This fix ensures the duplication feature works consistently from:
- ✅ Workout Library screen (via onDuplicate callback)
- ✅ Workout Detail screen (via Duplicate button)

Both methods now create duplicates in "My Workouts" as user workouts with proper naming.
