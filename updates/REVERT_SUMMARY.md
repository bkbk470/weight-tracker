## Files to Delete Manually:

Please manually delete these two files that were created during the session:

1. `WORKOUT_FOLDERS_LAST_COMPLETED.md` (marked for deletion)
2. `WORKOUT_LIBRARY_LAST_COMPLETED.md` (marked for deletion)

You can delete them with:
```bash
rm WORKOUT_FOLDERS_LAST_COMPLETED.md
rm WORKOUT_LIBRARY_LAST_COMPLETED.md
```

## What Was Removed:

The "last completed" feature that showed:
- When each workout was last completed
- Relative time display (e.g., "2 days ago at 3:45 PM")
- Visual status indicators with icons
- Database queries to workout_logs table

## Current State:

Your app is now back to its original state before today's modifications. The workout library and folders screens show workouts without any completion date information.

## Next Steps:

1. Run `flutter pub get` to ensure dependencies are synced
2. Hot restart your app (press 'R' in terminal or Shift+R)
3. Optionally delete the two markdown files listed above
4. The app should now work exactly as it did before

## Note:

If you want to re-implement this feature in the future, the documentation files contain all the implementation details before they're deleted.
