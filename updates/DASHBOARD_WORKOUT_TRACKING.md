# Dashboard Workout Tracking - Feature Added

## Overview
Added workout completion tracking to the Dashboard screen's "My Workouts" section.

## What Was Added

### Visual Improvements:
1. **Icon before each workout**: Fitness dumbbell icon (ðŸ’ª) displayed before workout name
2. **Last completed information**: Shows when the workout was last done
3. **Status indicators**:
   - âœ“ Check circle icon (green) for completed workouts
   - âš  Error icon (red) for never-completed workouts
4. **Time formatting**: Human-readable format like "2 days ago at 3:45 PM"

## Changes Made

### 1. Updated `dashboard_screen.dart`

#### New State Variables:
```dart
Map<String, DateTime?> _workoutLastCompletedDates = {};
```

#### New Methods Added:
```dart
// Query to get last workout date from workout_logs
Future<DateTime?> _getLastWorkoutDate(String workoutId)

// Format the completion date/time
String _formatLastCompleted(DateTime? date)
```

#### Updated `_MyWorkoutTile` Widget:
- Added `lastCompleted` parameter
- Added `hasBeenCompleted` parameter  
- Now displays:
  - Workout icon before name
  - Exercise count and duration
  - Last completed date with icon

### 2. Updated `pubspec.yaml`
Added the `intl` package for date/time formatting:
```yaml
dependencies:
  intl: ^0.18.0
```

## How It Works

### Data Flow:
1. Dashboard loads all workouts
2. For each workout, queries `workout_logs` table for most recent completion
3. Stores completion dates in `_workoutLastCompletedDates` map
4. Displays formatted date/time in workout tile

### Time Display Formats:
- **Today**: "Today at 3:45 PM"
- **Yesterday**: "Yesterday at 10:30 AM"
- **< 7 days**: "2 days ago at 6:15 PM"
- **< 30 days**: "3 weeks ago at 8:00 AM"
- **< 365 days**: "2 months ago at 2:30 PM"
- **> 365 days**: "1 year ago at 4:20 PM"
- **Never**: "Never completed" (shown in red)

## UI Layout

Each workout in the "My Workouts" folders now shows:

```
ðŸ’ª Push Day
   5 exercises â€¢ 45 min
   âœ“ 2 days ago at 3:45 PM
```

Or for never-completed workouts:

```
ðŸ’ª Pull Day
   1 exercises â€¢ 6 min
   âš  Never completed
```

## Installation & Testing

### Step 1: Install Dependencies
```bash
flutter pub get
```

### Step 2: Restart App
```bash
# Hot restart (press 'R' in terminal or Shift+R)
# Or stop and restart:
flutter run
```

**Important**: Use hot RESTART (not hot reload) since we modified initialization logic.

### Step 3: Test
1. Open the app and go to Dashboard (Home tab)
2. Expand a folder or "My Workouts" section
3. You should see:
   - Icon before each workout name
   - Exercise count and duration
   - Last completed info below

### To Test with Completed Workouts:
1. Tap on a workout
2. Start and complete the workout
3. Return to Dashboard
4. The workout should show "Today at [current time]"

## Files Modified

1. âœ… `lib/screens/dashboard_screen.dart` - Added tracking feature
2. âœ… `pubspec.yaml` - Added intl dependency

## Database Requirements

Uses existing `workout_logs` table:
- `workout_id` - References the workout template
- `start_time` - When workout was started
- `user_id` - User who completed the workout

No database changes needed!

## Visual Examples

### Before:
```
My Workouts (4 workouts)
  Pish Day
  1 exercises â€¢ 6 min

  Pull Day  
  1 exercises â€¢ 6 min
```

### After:
```
My Workouts (4 workouts)
  ðŸ’ª Pish Day
     1 exercises â€¢ 6 min
     âœ“ 2 days ago at 3:45 PM

  ðŸ’ª Pull Day
     1 exercises â€¢ 6 min
     âš  Never completed
```

## Features

- âœ… Icon before each workout
- âœ… Days/weeks/months ago calculation
- âœ… Time of day when completed
- âœ… Visual status indicators (check/error icons)
- âœ… Color-coded (green for completed, red for never)
- âœ… Handles all edge cases (today, yesterday, never, etc.)
- âœ… Works in both folders and "My Workouts" section

## Notes

- Completion tracking is based on `workout_logs` table
- Only shows in Dashboard's "My Workouts" section (expandable folders)
- Does not affect the "Recent Workouts" section (that already shows dates)
- Automatically refreshes when you return to dashboard after completing a workout
- Gracefully handles workouts that have never been completed

## Troubleshooting

### Icon not showing?
- Make sure you did a hot restart (not just hot reload)
- Check that the workout is in an expanded folder

### "Never completed" always showing?
- Check that you've actually completed a workout
- Verify the workout_logs table has entries
- Ensure the workout_id matches between tables

### Package error?
```bash
flutter clean
flutter pub get
flutter run
```

## Future Enhancements

Possible improvements:
1. Add workout streak counter
2. Show total times completed
3. Add "overdue" warning if not done in X days
4. Sort workouts by last completed date
5. Add completion percentage/progress bar
6. Show average workout duration
