# Fix: Body Measurements Time Display

## Problem
Body measurements were showing `00:00` for all times instead of the actual time when the measurement was taken.

## Root Cause
The database column `measurement_date` was defined as `DATE` type (which only stores dates), instead of `TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE` (which stores both date and time).

## Solution

### Step 1: Run the Database Migration
You need to run the SQL migration script on your Supabase database:

1. Go to your Supabase project dashboard
2. Navigate to **SQL Editor**
3. Open and run the file: `fix_measurement_timestamp.sql`

This script will:
- Change the `measurement_date` column from `DATE` to `TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE`
- Preserve all existing measurement data
- Update the database index

### Step 2: Code Changes (Already Applied)
The following code changes have been made:

1. **supabase_service.dart** - Fixed to save full timestamp:
   ```dart
   'measurement_date': measurementDate.toIso8601String(),
   ```
   (Previously was stripping time with `.split('T')[0]`)

2. **supabase_schema.sql** - Updated for future installations:
   ```sql
   measurement_date TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE NOT NULL,
   ```

### Step 3: Test
After running the migration:
1. Restart your app
2. Add a new measurement (e.g., weight)
3. Check the history - it should now show the actual time (e.g., "Oct 15, 2025 • 14:30")

## Note
- **Existing measurements** will still show `00:00` because they were saved with only the date
- **New measurements** (after migration) will display the correct time
- The time is displayed in **24-hour military format** (e.g., 14:30, 23:45)

## Files Modified
- ✅ `lib/services/supabase_service.dart` - Fixed timestamp saving
- ✅ `supabase_schema.sql` - Updated schema for new installations
- ✅ `fix_measurement_timestamp.sql` - Migration script created

## Time Format
The app displays time in 24-hour format as requested:
```
Jan 15, 2025 • 14:30
Oct 15, 2025 • 09:15
Dec 25, 2025 • 23:45
```
