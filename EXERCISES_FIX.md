# ✅ Fixed: Exercises Now Save to Database!

## Problem
When creating custom exercises, they were only saved to local storage and not to Supabase. This meant:
- ❌ Exercises didn't sync across devices
- ❌ Exercises weren't visible in the database
- ❌ Data could be lost if app was uninstalled

## Solution
Updated all screens to use **Supabase + Local Storage** pattern:
1. Save to Supabase first (cloud)
2. Cache in local storage (offline)
3. Load from Supabase (latest data)
4. Fall back to local storage if offline

## Files Updated

### 1. Create Exercise Screen
**File:** `lib/screens/create_exercise_screen.dart`

**What Changed:**
```dart
// OLD - Only local storage ❌
await LocalStorageService.instance.saveExercise(exercise);

// NEW - Supabase + Local Storage ✅
// Save to local storage first (offline support)
await LocalStorageService.instance.saveExercise(exercise);

// Save to Supabase (cloud backup)
await SupabaseService.instance.createExercise(
  name: name,
  category: category,
  difficulty: difficulty,
  equipment: equipment,
  notes: notes,
);
```

### 2. Exercises Screen
**File:** `lib/screens/exercises_screen.dart`

**What Changed:**
```dart
// OLD - Only local storage ❌
final saved = LocalStorageService.instance.getAllExercises();

// NEW - Supabase first, local fallback ✅
try {
  // Load from Supabase (latest data)
  final exercises = await SupabaseService.instance.getExercises();
  
  // Cache to local storage for offline
  for (var exercise in exercises) {
    await LocalStorageService.instance.saveExercise(exercise);
  }
} catch (e) {
  // Fall back to local storage if offline
  final saved = LocalStorageService.instance.getAllExercises();
}
```

### 3. Active Workout Screen
**File:** `lib/screens/active_workout_screen.dart`

**What Changed:**
- Exercise picker dialog now loads from Supabase
- Shows latest exercises from database
- Falls back to local storage if offline

### 4. Workout Detail Screen  
**File:** `lib/screens/workout_detail_screen.dart`

**What Changed:**
- Exercise picker dialog now loads from Supabase
- Shows latest exercises when adding to workouts
- Falls back to local storage if offline
