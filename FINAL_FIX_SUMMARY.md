# Final Fix: Workout Template Persistence - Complete Solution

## Problem
Workout data (weights, reps, rest) was not persisting between workout sessions. Users had to re-enter values every time they started the same workout.

## Root Cause
1. Database didn't have a `set_details` column to store individual set data
2. Workout template data was cached and not refreshed from database
3. Loading used cached workout object instead of fetching fresh data with updated `set_details`

---

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Database Migration âœ…
Added `set_details` JSONB column to store all set details:
```sql
ALTER TABLE workout_exercises
ADD COLUMN set_details JSONB;
```

### 2. Save Flow âœ…
When you finish a workout, `_syncAllWorkoutExercises()` saves:
```dart
'set_details': [
  {weight: 135, reps: 12, rest: 150},
  {weight: 185, reps: 8, rest: 180},
  ...
]
```

To the `workout_exercises` table for each exercise in the template.

### 3. Load Flow âœ… (NEW FIX)
When you open a workout detail screen, it now:
1. **Refetches from database** using `getWorkout()` instead of using cached data
2. **Loads fresh `set_details`** from the database
3. **Builds exercises** with the latest weights/reps/rest

**File:** `main.dart` (lines 614-639)
```dart
case 'workout-detail':
  // Refetch workout from database to get latest set_details
  if (workout != null && workout['id'] != null) {
    return FutureBuilder<Map<String, dynamic>?>(
      future: SupabaseService.instance.getWorkout(workout['id'] as String),
      builder: (context, snapshot) {
        final freshWorkout = snapshot.data ?? workout;
        final workoutExercises = _buildWorkoutExercises(freshWorkout);
        // ... builds WorkoutDetailScreen with fresh data
      },
    );
  }
```

## Complete Data Flow

### First Workout:
1. Open "Day 1 - Push" template
2. Template has default values (weight=0 or old values)
3. Start workout â†’ Loads from history â†’ Auto-fills weights/reps/rest
4. Do workout: Set 1 = 135 lbs Ã— 12 reps, rest 150s
5. Finish workout â†’ **Saves to `set_details`:** `[{weight: 135, reps: 12, rest: 150}, ...]`

### Second Workout:
1. Open "Day 1 - Push" template again
2. **NEW:** App refetches workout from database
3. **NEW:** Loads `set_details` with weights 135, 185, 205, etc.
4. Start workout â†’ Fields show: 135 lbs, 12 reps, 150s rest âœ…
5. Increase weight: 140 lbs
6. Finish workout â†’ Saves new `set_details`: `[{weight: 140, ...}, ...]`

### Third Workout:
1. Open template â†’ **Refetches** â†’ Loads `set_details` with 140 lbs
2. Start workout â†’ Shows 140 lbs âœ…
3. Progressive overload continues...

## What Changed

### Before:
```
Open workout â†’ Uses cached data â†’ Old weights (0 or stale)
Finish workout â†’ Saves to set_details
Reopen workout â†’ STILL uses cached data â†’ Old weights (no update!)
```

### After:
```
Open workout â†’ **Refetches from DB** â†’ Fresh weights from set_details
Finish workout â†’ Saves to set_details
Reopen workout â†’ **Refetches from DB** â†’ **Updated weights!** âœ…
```

## Testing Steps

1. **Finish any active workout** (to test fresh)

2. **Open a saved workout template**
   - Example: "Day 1 - Push"
   - Console should show: `ðŸ“¥ Loading Bench Press from set_details: [{weight: X, ...}]`

3. **Start the workout**
   - Verify fields show your last workout's weights/reps/rest

4. **Make changes:**
   - Set 1: Change 135 â†’ 140 lbs
   - Set 2: Change 8 â†’ 10 reps

5. **Finish the workout**
   - Console shows: `âœ… Successfully synced Bench Press template`

6. **Go back to dashboard**

7. **Open the same workout again**
   - **NEW:** You'll see a brief loading spinner (refetching from DB)
   - **NEW:** Template should show updated values (140 lbs, 10 reps)

8. **Start the workout**
   - Fields should show 140 lbs, 10 reps âœ…

## Console Logs to Verify

### When Opening Workout:
```
ðŸ“¥ Loading Bench Press from set_details: [{weight: 140, reps: 12, rest: 150}, ...]
âœ… Loaded 4 sets from set_details for Bench Press
```

### When Finishing Workout:
```
ðŸ”„ Syncing all workout exercises to template...
ðŸ’¾ Syncing Bench Press template:
   - Sets: 4
   - Set details: [{weight: 140, reps: 12, rest: 150}, ...]
âœ… Successfully synced Bench Press template
âœ… All exercises synced to template
```

### When Reopening:
- Brief loading spinner appears
- Same logs as "When Opening Workout" above, but with NEW values

---

## Files Modified

1. **`SUPABASE_MIGRATION_SET_DETAILS.sql`** - Database migration (MUST RUN FIRST!)
2. **`active_workout_screen.dart`** - Saves `set_details` when syncing template
3. **`main.dart`** - Refetches workout from DB before showing detail screen
4. **`supabase_service.dart`** - Includes `rest_time_seconds` in history query

---

## Troubleshooting

### Weights still not updating?

**Check:**
1. Did you run the migration? (`set_details` column exists?)
   ```sql
   SELECT column_name FROM information_schema.columns
   WHERE table_name = 'workout_exercises' AND column_name = 'set_details';
   ```

2. Is data being saved?
   ```sql
   SELECT e.name, we.set_details
   FROM workout_exercises we
   JOIN exercises e ON we.exercise_id = e.id
   WHERE we.workout_id = 'YOUR_WORKOUT_ID';
   ```

3. Check console for errors when opening workout
   - Should see "Loading X from set_details"
   - Should NOT see "No set_details for X, using defaults"

4. Full app restart (not hot reload):
   ```bash
   flutter run
   ```

## Success Criteria âœ…

- [ ] Migration run successfully (`set_details` column exists)
- [ ] Console shows "Successfully synced" when finishing workout
- [ ] Console shows "Loading X from set_details" when opening workout
- [ ] Weights/reps/rest persist between sessions
- [ ] Can do progressive overload (values increase and save)
- [ ] Works offline (falls back to local history)

**Implementation Date:** October 25, 2025
**Status:** âœ… Complete and Ready to Test

**Key Insight:** The missing piece was refetching the workout from the database. Without it, the app used stale cached data even though the database had the correct values!
