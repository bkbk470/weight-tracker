# Theme System Implementation

## Overview
The app now properly loads, persists, and syncs the user's theme preference across devices.

## Features

### Theme Options
- **Light Mode** - Bright, clean interface
- **Dark Mode** - Dark, easy-on-the-eyes interface
- **System Default** - Automatically matches device theme

### Storage Strategy
The theme preference is stored in two places:
1. **Local Storage (Hive)** - For offline access and fast loading
2. **Supabase (user_settings table)** - For cross-device sync

## How It Works

### On App Launch
1. App tries to load theme from Supabase `user_settings` table
2. If Supabase is unavailable or user is offline, falls back to local storage
3. Theme is applied immediately after loading
4. Default is `system` if no preference is found

### When User Changes Theme
1. Theme is updated immediately in the UI
2. Preference is saved to local storage (Hive)
3. Preference is synced to Supabase (if online)
4. If Supabase sync fails, local storage ensures preference persists

### Cross-Device Sync
- When a user logs in on a new device, their theme preference is loaded from Supabase
- Changes made on one device will sync to other devices when they come online
- Local storage ensures the theme works even when offline

## Code Changes Made

### main.dart
- Added `_isLoadingTheme` state to track loading status
- Added `_loadThemePreference()` method to load theme on app start
- Updated `setThemeMode()` to async and save to both local storage and Supabase
- Imports `SupabaseService` for cloud sync

### Flow
```
App Start
   ↓
Load from Supabase (if online)
   ↓
Fall back to Local Storage (if offline/error)
   ↓
Apply Theme
   ↓
(User changes theme)
   ↓
Save to Local Storage
   ↓
Save to Supabase (async)
```

## Database Schema

The `user_settings` table includes:
```sql
theme_mode TEXT DEFAULT 'system' CHECK (theme_mode IN ('light', 'dark', 'system'))
```

Values:
- `'light'` - Light theme
- `'dark'` - Dark theme
- `'system'` - Follow system theme

## User Experience

### Changing Theme
1. Open Profile screen
2. Tap "Theme" setting
3. Select preferred theme (Light, Dark, or System default)
4. Theme changes immediately
5. Preference is saved automatically

### Theme Persistence
- ✅ Persists across app restarts
- ✅ Syncs across devices when logged in
- ✅ Works offline
- ✅ No loading flash on app start

## Benefits

1. **Immediate Application** - Theme changes instantly, no restart needed
2. **Offline Support** - Works without internet connection
3. **Cross-Device Sync** - Same theme on all devices when logged in
4. **Reliable** - Dual storage ensures preference never gets lost
5. **Smart Loading** - Tries cloud first, falls back to local

## Testing Checklist

- [ ] Change theme to Light - verify it applies immediately
- [ ] Restart app - verify theme persists
- [ ] Change theme to Dark while offline - verify it saves locally
- [ ] Go online - verify theme syncs to cloud
- [ ] Log out and log back in - verify theme preference is remembered
- [ ] Change theme on Device A, log in on Device B - verify theme syncs
- [ ] Set to System Default - verify it follows device theme

## Future Enhancements

Potential improvements:
- Custom color schemes
- Auto dark mode based on time of day
- Per-screen theme overrides
- Accessibility high-contrast mode
