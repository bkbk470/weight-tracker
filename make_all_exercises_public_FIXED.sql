-- ============================================================
-- Make All Exercises Public (Default) - Visible to All Users
-- ============================================================
-- FIXED VERSION - This script converts all exercises to default/public
-- so that every user can see and choose them
--
-- Run this in your Supabase SQL Editor:
-- https://supabase.com/dashboard/project/YOUR_PROJECT/sql
-- ============================================================

-- STEP 1: Check current state BEFORE update
-- ============================================================
SELECT '========== BEFORE UPDATE ==========' as step;

SELECT
  'Total exercises: ' || COUNT(*)::text as info
FROM exercises;

SELECT
  'Default exercises (visible to all): ' || COUNT(*)::text as info
FROM exercises
WHERE is_default = true;

SELECT
  'Custom exercises (user-specific): ' || COUNT(*)::text as info
FROM exercises
WHERE is_custom = true;

SELECT
  is_default,
  is_custom,
  CASE WHEN user_id IS NULL THEN 'NULL' ELSE 'has user_id' END as user_id_status,
  COUNT(*) as count
FROM exercises
GROUP BY is_default, is_custom, CASE WHEN user_id IS NULL THEN 'NULL' ELSE 'has user_id' END
ORDER BY count DESC;

-- STEP 2: Update ALL exercises to be default/public
-- ============================================================
SELECT '========== UPDATING EXERCISES ==========' as step;

UPDATE exercises
SET
  is_default = true,    -- Make visible to all users
  is_custom = false,    -- Not a custom exercise
  user_id = NULL        -- No specific owner (available to everyone)
WHERE is_default = false OR is_default IS NULL;

-- STEP 3: Verify the update worked
-- ============================================================
SELECT '========== AFTER UPDATE ==========' as step;

SELECT
  'Total exercises: ' || COUNT(*)::text as info
FROM exercises;

SELECT
  'Default exercises (visible to all): ' || COUNT(*)::text as info
FROM exercises
WHERE is_default = true;

SELECT
  'Custom exercises (user-specific): ' || COUNT(*)::text as info
FROM exercises
WHERE is_custom = true;

-- Should show all exercises have: is_default=true, is_custom=false, user_id=NULL
SELECT

  is_custom,
  user_id IS NULL as user_id_is_null,
  COUNT(*) as count
FROM exercises
GROUP BY is_default, is_custom, user_id IS NULL
ORDER BY count DESC;

-- STEP 4: Check exercises by category
-- ============================================================
SELECT '========== EXERCISES BY CATEGORY ==========' as step;

SELECT
  category,
  COUNT(*) as exercise_count
FROM exercises
WHERE is_default = true
GROUP BY category
ORDER BY category;

-- STEP 5: Sample exercises to verify
-- ============================================================
SELECT '========== SAMPLE EXERCISES ==========' as step;

SELECT

  category,
  difficulty,
  equipment,
  is_default,

-- STEP 6: Ensure proper Row Level Security (RLS) policies
-- ============================================================
SELECT '========== SETTING UP RLS POLICIES ==========' as step;

-- Drop existing policies if they exist
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Users can view default exercises" ON exercises;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Users can view their own exercises" ON exercises;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Users can view default and own exercises" ON exercises;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Users can create their own exercises" ON exercises;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Users can update their own exercises" ON exercises;

CREATE POLICY "Users can view default and own exercises" ON exercises

-- Create INSERT policy: Users can only create custom exercises with their own user_id

-- Create DELETE policy: Users can only delete their own custom exercises
CREATE POLICY "Users can delete their own exercises" ON exercises
  FOR DELETE
  USING (auth.uid() = user_id AND is_custom = true);

SELECT 'âœ… RLS policies created successfully' as result;

-- STEP 7: Final verification - Test the app query
-- ============================================================
SELECT '========== TESTING APP QUERY ==========' as step;

-- This simulates the exact query your app uses
SELECT
  'Exercises visible via app query: ' || COUNT(*)::text as result
FROM exercises
WHERE is_default = true;

-- Show sample of what users will see
SELECT
  name,
  category,
  difficulty,
  equipment
FROM exercises
WHERE is_default = true
ORDER BY category, name
LIMIT 10;

-- STEP 8: Show sample exercises per category (FIXED)
-- ============================================================
SELECT '========== SAMPLE EXERCISES PER CATEGORY ==========' as step;

SELECT
  category,
  COUNT(*) as total_count,
  (SELECT STRING_AGG(name, ', ')
   FROM (
     SELECT name
     FROM exercises e2
     WHERE e2.category = e1.category AND e2.is_default = true
     ORDER BY name
     LIMIT 3
   ) sub
  ) as sample_3_exercises
FROM exercises e1
WHERE is_default = true
GROUP BY category
ORDER BY category;

-- STEP 9: Success summary
-- ============================================================
SELECT '========== âœ… SUCCESS SUMMARY ==========' as step;

WITH stats AS (
  SELECT COUNT(*) as total_count
  FROM exercises
  WHERE is_default = true
)
SELECT 'ðŸŽ‰ All exercises are now public/default!' as message
UNION ALL
