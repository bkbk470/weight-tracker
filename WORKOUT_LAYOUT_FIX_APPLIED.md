# Active Workout Screen Layout Fix - Applied

## Issue
On iPhone, the workout set row was getting cut off because it had too many elements with fixed widths that exceeded the screen width.

## Changes Applied

### 1. Added Horizontal Scrolling
Wrapped the set row content in `SingleChildScrollView` with horizontal scrolling so users can swipe if content is wider than screen.

```dart
SingleChildScrollView(
  scrollDirection: Axis.horizontal,
  child: IntrinsicHeight(
    child: Row(
      children: [
        // All set elements
      ],
    ),
  ),
)
```

### 2. Reduced Padding
Changed container padding from `all(12)` to `symmetric(horizontal: 8, vertical: 10)` to save space.

### 3. Reduced Spacing
- Set number width: 50px → 40px
- Spacing between elements: 12px → 8px  
- Complete button width: 60px → 48px
- Removed `Spacer()` widget
- Reduced button sizes slightly

### 4. Made Buttons More Compact
- Added `padding: EdgeInsets.zero` to buttons
- Added explicit `constraints` to control minimum size
- Reduced icon sizes: 28px → 26px, 20px → 18px

## Results

**Before:**
- Fixed width elements: ~400px minimum
- Content cut off on smaller iPhones
- No way to see all elements

**After:**
- Reduced minimum width: ~340px
- Horizontal scroll available if needed
- All elements visible and accessible
- More compact, professional appearance

## Layout Breakdown

Current set row elements (left to right):
1. **Set Number** - 40px
2. **Spacing** - 8px
3. **Weight Input** - 70px (with previous data below)
4. **Spacing** - 8px
5. **Reps Input** - 60px (with previous data below)
6. **Spacing** - 8px
7. **Rest Timer** - 60px (tappable)
8. **Spacing** - 4px
9. **Complete Button** - 48px
10. **Delete Button** (if>1 set) - 32px

**Total:** ~338px + padding = fits on most iPhones!

## Testing Checklist

Test on different iPhone sizes:
- [ ] iPhone SE (375px width) - smallest
- [ ] iPhone 13/14 (390px width) - common
- [ ] iPhone 14 Pro Max (430px width) - largest

Verify:
- [ ] All elements visible
- [ ] Can tap all buttons
- [ ] Previous data displays correctly
- [ ] Rest timer shows properly
- [ ] Horizontal scroll works if needed
- [ ] No layout overflow errors

## Additional Notes

- The horizontal scroll is subtle - users may not notice it unless content is very wide
- Most users won't need to scroll as the compact layout fits on screen
- If more space is needed in future, consider:
  - Two-row layout for each set
  - Collapsible previous data
  - Modal for editing weight/reps instead of inline

## Files Modified

- `lib/screens/active_workout_screen.dart`
  - Set row layout (lines ~1580-1800)
  - Added SingleChildScrollView wrapper
  - Reduced widths and spacing
  - Made buttons more compact

## Future Improvements

Possible enhancements:
- [ ] Auto-hide previous data to save space
- [ ] Swipe gestures to complete/delete sets
- [ ] Landscape layout optimization
- [ ] Tablet-specific wider layout
- [ ] Configurable compact/comfortable view modes
